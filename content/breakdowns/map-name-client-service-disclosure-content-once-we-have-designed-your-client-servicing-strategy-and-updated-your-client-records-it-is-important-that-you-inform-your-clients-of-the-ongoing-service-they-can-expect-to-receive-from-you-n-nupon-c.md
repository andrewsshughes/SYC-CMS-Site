  Once we have designed your Client Servicing Strategy and updated your client
  records, it is important that you inform your clients of the ongoing service
  they can expect to receive from you.


  Upon completion of the Client Servicing Strategy, we will write out to your clients via iBusiness ensuring we track all correspondence.


  This letter will contain a copy of your Client Service Charter and a Client Servicing Questionnaire with a pre-paid envelope. Upon receipt of a completed questionnaire, we will attach a copy to iBusiness and update the client records accordingly.
